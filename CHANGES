0.5: Merged patch from Thomas DuBuisson, added instances for MonadFix. I was also getting warnings about Control.Monad.Error being deprecated in favor of Monad.Control.Except so, I changed it.

0.4: Added Applicative instances for Supply and SupplyT.

0.3: Two new functions, added at the request of Stefan Holdermans at Vector
Fabrics. The first, exhausted, checks whether the supply is empty. The second,
peek, will return the next element without removing it from the supply.

0.2: Exported supply. Also added some monad transformer instances at the
request of ozgurakgun.

0.1: First public release.
